## About this app

This web app is a fun project that counts up the time since Man United last won the Premier League.

V1 is a simple countup from a hardcoded date (13/05/2013) to the current date. Future iterations of this app could include selected different football teams, or even different sports - which would require a database of dates since each team won their respective league or competition.

V2 could allow selecting any Premier League team from a dropdown to show the time since they last won the league. This would require a database of dates since each team won the Premier League.

Currently, this is a pure front end app with no server or database.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
